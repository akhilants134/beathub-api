# 🎵 BeatHub API

A backend REST API designed to manage and serve music-related data, built to practice real-world backend concepts like API design, routing, and data handling.

> This project focuses on building scalable backend logic rather than UI — simulating how real services power applications behind the scenes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- RESTful API architecture
- Organized routes and controllers
- CRUD operations on music-related resources
- JSON-based request & response handling
- Beginner-friendly but extendable backend structure

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Most beginner projects stop at frontend interfaces.  
**BeatHub API** was built to understand:

- How backend services are structured
- How APIs power applications
- How data flows between client and server
- How to design endpoints clearly and logically

This project helped me move from *“writing code”* to *“building systems.”*
